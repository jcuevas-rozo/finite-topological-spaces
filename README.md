## Finite topological spaces in Kenzo

This repository contains an external module of the Kenzo program for finite topological spaces computations. Kenzo's original version can be found at http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/ and a repackaged version is available at https://github.com/gheber/kenzo.

We have implemented different functions in order to use point reductions methods for computing the core and a 'weak core' of finite topological spaces [1]. The computation of homology groups with generators of h-regular finite topological spaces has been implemented and the technique of discrete vector fields has been used in order to improve the previous algorithms. We refer to [2] for theoretical results and examples of these algorithms.
